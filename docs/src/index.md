# Mire.jl

**M**odes **I**n **R**otating **E**llipsoids

Toolbox written in Julia to solve eigen modes of rapidly rotating (magneto)hydrodynamics in an ellipsoid using Cartesian polynomials.

Some example usage is given in the section Documentation and in the [Continuous Integration file](https://github.com/fgerick/Mire.jl/blob/master/test/modes.jl).

## Installation

Install `Mire.jl` from the `julia` `REPL` prompt with

```julia
] add https://github.com/fgerick/Mire.jl.git
```

## Development
Mire.jl is currently developed by [Felix Gerick](https://github.com/fgerick)
